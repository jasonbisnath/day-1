    <h1>Hello, Gakko!</h1>
    <p> Today I Took the 7 bus then I took the A train to this area then finally I walked torwards here. I saw many old people selling fake jewelry and designer and I saw the Stadium Goods market center and I saw a man with a Supreme bag and Yeezys from Stadium Goods in another bag. </p>
    <d> Started. October very's own but it looks like July 4. I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year. I swear I could beat Serena when she playing with her left. Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doing me. I can you teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone. I was running through the 6 with my woes. I might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence. Tuck my napkin in my shirt cause I'm just mobbin' like that. She said they miss the old Drake. Girl don't tempt me. All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait. I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures. How you feel, how you feel, how you feel? 25 sittin' on $25 mil. And this girl right here, who knows what she knows? So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom. Where ya at? I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back. I wear every single chain even when I'm in the house. There used to never want to hear us, remember? Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai. I'm the light-skinned Keith Sweat. After hours of Il Mulino or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino. The contract like '91 Dan Marino. We got Santa Margherita by the liter. Last name, ever. First name, greatest. Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation. YOLO.</d>
